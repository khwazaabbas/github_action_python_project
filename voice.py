Every night in my dreams

I see you, I feel you

That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance

And spaces between us

You have come to show you go on

Near, Far,

Wherever you are,

I believe that the heart does go on

Once more, you opened the door

Rs 1 Trial
And you're here in my heart and

My heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time

And last for a lifetime

And never let go till we're gone

Love was when I loved you,

One true time I hold you,

In my life we'll always go on

Near, far,

Wherever you are,

I believe that the heart does go on

Once more, you opened the door

And you're here in my heart and

My heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear

And I know that my heart will go on

We'll stay, forever this way

You are safe in my heart and

My heart will go on and on
